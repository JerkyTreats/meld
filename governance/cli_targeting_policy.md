# CLI Targeting Policy

Date: 2026-03-01
Status: active

## Intent

Project direction is to make `--path` the default targeting mode for CLI flows.

## Rules

- Always call out each command surface where path is not default behavior.
- In plans specs reviews and implementation notes include a short exception list for non default path behavior.
