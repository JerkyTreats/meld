# Docs Style Policy

## Architecture And Workflow Diagrams

- Prefer Mermaid style diagrams for architecture and workflow visuals when a diagram improves clarity.
- Keep diagrams near the related plan or spec section so design intent and ownership boundaries remain explicit.
- Use concise labels that match domain terms used in code and design docs.

## Markdown Parentheses Rule

- Do not use literal `(` or `)` in Markdown prose.
- Parentheses are allowed only when required by Markdown formatting syntax such as `[label](/path)`.
- Parentheses are allowed inside inline code and fenced code blocks.
